Feature: Merge Articles
  As a blog administrator
  In order to DRY out the blog's articles
  I want to be able to merge two existing articles
  
  # background: 
  # blog is set up
  # and i am logged into the admin panel
  # and i have written an article with title "1" and body "ASDGFASDFASDF"
  # and i have written an article with title "2" and body "ASDGFASDFASDF2"
  # and i have followed the "1" link
  
  
  #Scenario: A non-admin cannot merge two articles
  # switch to non-admin user 
	# follow Users
	# follow admin
	# Profile to Blog publisher
  
  
  #Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should contain the text of both previous articles
